New Earth Nation is founded in recognition of the supremacy of consciousness, the unity of all life and the undeniability of the individual sovereign condition.

It is an open invitation to every member of the human family to transition away from all systems and enclosures which limit our capacity for creative self expression, and instead unite as an extraterritorial family of sovereign individuals who, with the support and solidarity of that family, are collectively empowered to consciously cocreate a new paradigm of prosperity, harmony and abundance.  

The first step in this process is for each of us to formally withdraw our consent to be governed by those who do not have our best interests at heart; and to declare to the world, who we are and what we stand for.

The New Earth Declaration of Sovereignty will align your voice with innumerable other voices in such a manner as to ensure, for the first time, that those who share a vision of peace and prosperity can no longer be ignored. 

Make your Declaration and enter the New Earth

        body: <<-BODY
By making a New Earth Declaration of Individual Sovereignty one gives permission to New Earth Nation and the New Earth Trust to 'represent' the broad interests of the maker when dealing at the state and multilateral level with so-called authorities, municipal parties, state-departments and governments in different parts of the world, in respect of any matter where the purpose of such representation is to:
%ul
  %li
    Protect those New Earth Citizens who are also New Earth Residents from interference with their unrestricted enjoyment of community lands and New Earth facilities.
  %li 
    Support the exercise of individual sovereign powers and the collective sovereign powers of New Earth Citizens.
  %li 
    Respect the principles and ethic of the New Earth Blueprint, in any manner whatsoever.

        title: "How current systems of government obtain their power over human beings",
        link: "How Government Obtains Power",
        body: <<-BODY
All governments, corporations and other institutions do not actually exist anywhere but in the collective minds of people. In reality they do not actually exist at all. They are given the effect of life through the belief of people in their existence, and they are given power by the willingness of those people to act on their behalf. 

For a government to enforce its rules and regulations upon human beings that belief must remain intact. However many years of blind voluntary compliance, has allowed governments to develop extremely complex webs of fiction to make it harder for Human Beings to recognize how they have been volunteering so that even when they decide not to continue voluntarily complying, they remain unwitting subjects of its powers. 

The exact procedures for how governments achieve this position vary from country to country but broadly it works as follows:

Shortly after a child is born most parents perform the voluntary act of attending a registry office, to cause the event of the child’s birth to be registered (it is not the child who is registered, only the event). 

The parents do not themselves register the event of the child’s birth, they provide information to a Registrar who in turn registers the event. A receipt is usually issued, often called a certificate of live birth (or something similar). 

The government then performs a process called ‘conversion’ which means the changing of realty to personalty (reality into fiction). To memorialize this act it issues a certificate to the parents, often called a ‘birth certificate’ (or something similar). Ironically a birth certificate is actually a death certificate, evidencing title to an ‘estate.’

The child is then usually sent to a school, which is either ran by the state or ran in accordance with the directions of the state, where he or she is made to answer, every day, to the name recorded on the birth certificate. This focused conditioning is supported all the way by a coordinated media machine and the teaching of the child’s parents and general society who themselves have been conditioned in the same manner, so that by the time the child leaves school around 16 years old, often even older, it has been conditioned to identify itself as the name on the birth certificate.

The normal course of life then usually requires that the young adult begin to sign forms of various kinds in order to progress through life. At the moment the young adult signs its first form claiming to be the person named upon it, it declares that it is dead and therefore subject to the rules of the land of the dead. 

Without this voluntary attachment, no legal process can be brought against a man or woman.

Without this voluntary attachment, a man or woman has no commercial liabilities, anywhere.

Without this voluntary attachment, a man or woman is in the world, not of it.

Without this voluntary attachment, a government has no power.

By redressing how we relate to this name (or estate) we reclaim the power of self-governance. However, when we reclaim this power, we have a greater responsibility to wield it with honesty, integrity and above all… Love.

        body: <<-BODY
It’s remarkably easy… you just do it! Quite simply there is no lawful requirement for anyone to do anything they do not wish to do. An authority only has power if you recognise it.

Sovereignty is a state of being. The absolute expression of a sovereign state of being, in each moment, is the only way in which one can realise the absolute freedom which true sovereignty can bring. None of the documents and procedures available through the New Earth Project, or anywhere else, are a solution to reclaiming sovereignty in and of itself.

A sovereign individual is one who:
%ul
  %li Answers to no one, except as he or she may, by the exercise of their free will, elect to
  %li Faces each moment without fear, regardless of what that moment brings
  %li Settles his or her disputes honestly and quickly
  %li Never intentionally causes harm or loss to another human being
  %li Quickly redresses any harm or loss inadvertently caused
  %li Endeavours to give more to a situation than he or she takes from it

How does one deal with agents and representatives of government and Institutions?

Most importantly, one maintains, at all times, a pure and perfect space of presence, calmness, compassion and love.

One does not accept the service of notices.

One does not speak with representatives of fictional authorities, one speaks with the brother and sister behind the mask, and one does so with love. 

When one speaks with a brother or sister who believes they wield some power:
(i) One does not make claims or statements – if one claims something, one will need to prove it, and it’s impossible to prove anything in reality.
(ii)  One does not answer questions, positively or negatively. Given the increasingly realised spiritual truth that one actually knows nothing for sure, how can anyone answer anything with any certainty?
(iii) One does not remain silent when addressed. Silence amounts to tacit acceptance. 
(iv)  Instead one speaks only in questions, tearing down all illusions. He who is asking questions is as-king. The sovereign asks the questions, the subject answers. Practicing at home with our loved ones is fun way for the whole family to master the art of honourable communication. If you can stay in honour in the home, you can do it anywhere!

If a brother of sister attempts to forcibly interfere with one’s lawful enjoyment of life in any way, one can politely remind them that they will be held personally responsible for any harm or loss they cause. 

If a brother or sister proceeds to cause harm or loss through the use of force, one commences an appropriate civil or criminal action against them, personally. The reality is that no government has ever harmed anyone – a government is an idea. It is the men and women acting on behalf of the idea who cause the harm, without those men and women there would be no harm done in the name of government. The only way to effectively balance the scales is to seek redress from the one who actually caused the harm or loss.

Whilst entering the New Earth requires us to forgive others, and ourselves, for mistakes made in the past, this does not mean that one ought to simply sit back and take abuse – an enlightened being is a doormat for no one.

        title: "Why the need for a Declaration of Sovereignty?",
        link: "Why the need?",
        body: <<-BODY
All men and women are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. It is men and women themselves who are solely responsible for securing these rights. 

When a government becomes destructive of these rights; 

When a government willingly allows vested interests to subject its people to unethical finance and banking practices which reduce those people to economic and financial enslavement;

When a government puts the interests of a military industrial complex ahead of the needs of its people;

When a long train of abuses and unethical behaviour pursuing consistently the same object reveal a design to reduce men and women under absolute tyranny;

And most of all, when the evolutionary progression of mankind is restrained by the very governments which men and women formed to cause its advancement;

It is the right and duty of every man and woman to throw off such government and to take on the responsibilities of self-governance.

In truth, no one need declare what is inherently theirs – one’s actions in exercising one’s sovereignty in each moment are what counts. However at a time when big government and vested interests have amassed more power than ever before, it is strength in numbers and power of purpose alone which will allow humanity to transcend the evolutionary constraints imposed on it by the operation of governments and globalist institutions.

The New Earth Declaration of Sovereignty will enjoin the voices of thousands, then millions, of men and women across the globe, across all cultural and religious divides – putting all governments & globalist institutions on notice that it is they who serve the people and not the other way round, and that their services are no longer required.

In the months and years to come, when necessary steps have been taken to ensure their credibility, the New Earth Trust may begin to issue its own passports and begin to make old state issued documents obsolete. That’s if the many quickly advancing Quantum Transportation technologies don’t render the need for passports obsolete! Until then it may at times be necessary for you to continue to use old state issued documents to go about your life.

This is easily achieved… you use everything you need to just as you have always done, but you stop permitting anyone to use the name listed thereon to personally identify you. 

Put simply when we cease making claims (this is MY name, that is MY passport), we begin to align ourselves with a fundamental truth of our existence on planet earth… everything has been provided, in abundance, for our use, without liability. Only the concept and illusion of ownership (an illusion which has been defined, controlled and perpetuated by the collective ego of mankind) prevents us from freely accessing that abundance. 

Bear in mind that:
%ul
  %li No law exists anywhere in the world that requires a man or woman to use money in order to survive.
  %li No law exists anywhere in the world that requires a man or woman to possess state issued documentation in order to move freely across land and sea.
  %li In fact no law exists anywhere is the world that requires a man or woman to even have a name, or to do anything whatsoever, period. So live your life as a (wo)man, drop the mask (persona), and step into your sovereign birthright.

        title: "New Earth Nation Defined",
        link: "Nation",
        body: <<-BODY
Etymology of, nation (n.), from Latin nationem literally, “that which has been born”

New Earth Nation is that which is given life by you, the Sovereign men and women who are its Citizens, to be THE free and open platform which unites humanity beyond all systems and enclosures which seek, by their very nature, to separate us from each other, and the Truth of our existence.

New Earth Nation is not seeking, and will never seek, recognition of status from the United Nations, it is, and will always be a supranational, extraterritorial collective of sovereign men and women who, by their own free will do consciously choose to live in accordance with natural law, to do no harm, and to mutually assist one another to advance their own perfection and that of the human condition.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines a nation as “a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular state or territory.” 

In the New Earth Nation, this common descent arises from the fundamental understanding that we are each born of the same thing – consciousness; this common culture is the expression of the immutable truth that we are all One; this common language is that which utters effortlessly from the quantum of the collective human heart; this particular state is that of joyful self-awareness; and this particular territory is manifest reality itself, not a segregated part of it, but the inseparable perfection of the whole. 

Technically and practically speaking, a sovereign man or woman is a nation in his/her own right. New Earth Nation is nothing more, or less, than a collective of sovereign nations uniting in a common interest… not unlike the founding tenets of many modern societies. The difference being that, in this society, the conditions do not exist for an individual’s sovereignty to be divested to another or for an individual’s sovereign powers to be falsely exercised by another, through deception, by virtue of the propagation of scarcity, fear, indoctrination and manipulation of media, or by any other means.

Citizenship has come to be a dirty word. The very definition of the word, in most jurisdictions, is such that by identifying oneself as a citizen, one is automatically divesting their Sovereignty by operation of Law.

But just as the rules of language allow anyone to define their own meaning for the words they use, so too does New Earth Nation hereby redefine the word citizenship, whenever it is used within the context of New Earth Nation, to mean:

“A man or woman who, having absolute sovereign power of his/her own nation state, without condition or limitation, and without presumption of subservience to anyone or anything, does endeavour to live in accordance with natural law, to do no harm, and to mutually assist one another to advance their own perfection and that of the human condition.”

This is the New Earth ‘social contract.’ As citizens of New Earth Nation, we endeavour to embody these principles in each moment.

        body: <<-BODY
New Earth Residency is the condition of being a New Earth Resident. A New Earth Resident is anyone who lives within a New Earth Community. New Earth Residencies may be permanent or transient.  

Historically, when one makes a claim of residency, the claim is generally used to subject one to regulation under the commercial laws of the nation state to which the claim relates. Such a claim carries no such liabilities in the New Earth. 

New Earth Nation defines a New Earth Resident as:

“A man or woman who inhabits a New Earth Community, whilst maintaining absolute sovereign power of his/her own nation state, without condition or limitation, and without presumption of subservience to anyone or anything, and who does endeavour to live in accordance with natural law, to do no harm, and to mutually assist one another to advance their own perfection and that of the human condition.”
