        body: <<-BODY
Economics – inspired from the Greek principle oikonomia or the management of the household – connotes the organization of a system that promotes the identification, utilization, proliferation, production, distribution, stewardship, consumption and exchange of goods, services, and experiences by a group or community.  One of the core principles of New Earth is the recognition that individual members within communities benefit from conscious exchange of value between and among each other and that this value exchange can be aligned to abundant gratitude and service.  Consciously honouring the manifold abundance of the physical and intangible realms, the New Earth recognizes the opportunities that emerge when the flow of value exchange – currency in its literal, flowing sense – is sentient and expressly honours all participating members in an ecosystem including the ecosystem itself.

Wealth in the New Earth is discerned by the facility with which members and communities can maximally access and exchange value with the least impediments to themselves and the ecosystem.  Acknowledging that abundance calls forth discernment, generosity and stewardship, our choice is to facilitate and honour the flow and transmission of value within networks rather than reinforcing fear induced scarcity illusions that lead to hoarding and insecurity.  Economic power, once synonymous with oppression, is reclaimed in light of the actual ease with which value exchange energy can flow throughout the ecosystem per unit time.  The more value exchange flow by and between actors in the systems, the more economic power.

Inspired by, and in homage to the abundant nature that surrounds us, we understand that economic systems must be sentient, scaled, and suitable.  Value must be discerned within and by the exchanging parties and must be explicitly offered and received.  Value cannot be imposed by fiat and can in no manner be an agent of indenture or suppression.  The flow of value within the system must be scaled to number of engaging participants and to the productivity of the same.  Perpetual growth (an attribute of malignant disease) and illusory excess (an attribute of ego) are set aside in favour of exchanges by and between rationale actors sharing common and aligned value understandings rendered in explicit form.  Units of value are aligned with the nature of value in exchange.  As often as possible, optimal utilization of stewarded resources is valued most highly when no surrogate of exchange (value temporarily stored as money) is required.  In short, conscious actors engaging freely with each other are emancipated from the singular surrogacy of the previous monetary systems of indenture and exploitative malignant growth.

In acknowledgment of that fact the transition to a worldwide economic transformation will be a phased experience with sovereign beings moving from previous paradigms into the new, New Earth introduces the New Earth Exchange. The New Earth Exchange is the transitional, alternative platform for transparent and transactional exchange which:

1.  Allows investments, large and small, to be made into New Earth developments & initiatives, and into other programs and initiatives which embody the New Earth ethic, without the reliance on indenture-based banking interests.

2.  Allows those investments to be deployed anywhere in the world on whatever is necessary to deliver the various developments & initiatives.

3.  Provides a repository for tangible resources which can collateralize the creation of a New Earth.

4.  Allows all people to use their old currencies to purchase New Earth homes (and other products) valued and sold in New Earth Currency.

5.  Offers a mutual credit ‘memory of transaction’ currency system, for use within the New Earth global community itself allowing communities and other project participants to exchange with each other around the planet.

6.  Offers non-indenture payments and currency systems for all mankind facilitating the protection of human freedom, liberty and privacy through free exchange for all people of the world, serving as a transition to a mutual credit system. 

Those expending their energy in service of any aspect of the New Earth Exchange do so from a place of service. At their election, they may receive exchangeable compensation in New Earth Promissories, and earnings are transparent.

        title: "About the New Earth Fund",
        link: "New Earth Fund",
        body: <<-BODY
The New Earth Fund is repository for money, securities and other forms of property (excluding real property). Domiciled in a jurisdiction which offers favourable local laws and treaty arrangements, it provides an environment for the protection of transitioning assets.  Unlike conventional fiduciary accounts, the New Earth Fund invests in and participates with investments that are indenture-free and productivity-aligned.  

The fund is ‘owned’ equally and proportionately by its depositors, who share equally and proportionately in its successes and failures.

The fund allocates resources in the following manner:

1.  One third held on reserve - spiritual emergency and security of the whole - serves the life and is the blood of the heart.

2.  One third for primary distribution to programs and initiatives founded on love and education / consciousness – a portion of which can be credited into New Earth Promissories with community, not investor returns and a portion of which can be allocated for risk and benefit-sharing participation in new venture creation within the New Earth ecosystem. 

3.  One third for primary distribution to efficient systems that serve the New Earth - return on investment a major focus.

People investing base their return on these three criteria – 1. Security, 2. Contribution to humanity, and 3. Investment in creativity & future innovation. 

This model is congruent with the three levels or triangle of the mystery school traditions across all cultures, and corresponds to the three levels of being: 

1.  As with Himalayan spirituality, where Shamballa is the spiritual centre within which the awakened life-force, and energy of planetary purpose exists in reservoir for the whole planet, and released at long intervals upon spiritual demand from the awakened masters and humanity, so too, in the New Earth Fund, are reserves only expended when the members of the fund collectively agree they are required (or to adjust the ratio upon losses in the other areas).

2.  Just as the awakened masters act as a bridge between Shamballa and humanity; their investment being in the development of awareness, growth of consciousness and loving / fair distribution of resources, so too does the New Earth Fund invest a third of its reserves with the same areas. At this level some investment will result in no return - interest free loans or profit sharing arrangements would apply if and when the investment is profitable. The preservation of capital is preferred but will not always be possible. As such, in some cases, capital will be donated - this volume of donations will be regulated annually based on a percentage of profits, such that not more than a third of total profits should be distributed by way of donations to extremely leveraged and needy causes and with the goal that this level of the fund’s operation will break even each year.

3.  Humanity expresses itself through creativity, economy and efficiency - the best of business on earth. Thus the Fund invests a third of its reserves on creative projects, utilising innovative technologies, which are designed to benefit humanity and/or the Earth as a whole. 

By proceeding from these foundations a growing reservoir and funding resource will be created which genuinely serves the whole earth and which is built up steadily over the long term, thereby generating trust as a result of its motives, transparency and performance. 

A realistic profit is be targeted annually with 50% being donated according to New Earth principles and 50% being distributed to the depositors. When the profit target is exceeded, increasing amounts are donated.

        title: "About the New Earth Promissory",
        link: "New Earth Promissory",
        body: <<-BODY
The New Earth Promissory is a medium of exchange explicitly for use by New Earth Project Members and Community Residents. The economic foundation of the New Earth Promissory is that of ‘Mutual Credit’.

No currency will be exchangeable with New Earth Promissories as they are created and extinguished by their users in accordance with mutual credit principles. 

The New Earth Promissory is a true energy backed currency.

There is a common misconception that an energy backed currency is one which is backed by energy produced by energy systems i.e. as measured against kWh. In contrast to this, the New Earth Promissory is instead backed by the only energy which has any relevance as a pure medium of exchange between human beings – human energy.  

New Earth Promissories encourage transacting parties to confirm "value" received. Thus human energy is valued by the degree to which it is appreciated.

New Earth Economist Leonardo Wilde describes it thus:

“Mutual credit implies an issuance against transactions. That is, if we buy something—a good or a service—the value of the transaction is equal in amount to the monetary emission. This means that the moment a purchase happens, one of the participants receives the product in exchange for delivering an amount of money that did not exist before the transaction took place.

We have three entities that participate in the process, alternating their roles:

1.  The participant who delivers the real value. (A seller who offers goods and/or services.)

2.  The participant who receives the real value, against which he/she issues currency. (A buyer who demands goods and/or services, for which he/she gives money.)

3.  The group or the economic circuit. (When a person or an institution is part of a social or commercial circuit, it accepts the social agreements as a participant. The basic social agreement is that participants must offer real value—goods and/or services—against their right to issue money.)

It works in the following way:

1.  A buys a basket of apples (the real value) from B for the price of 20 units of transaction value (UTV). To do this, A must pay B this value:

2.  A generates money, by electronic means, and gives it to B. (The amount of money has no value in itself, it works as a registry of transferred value.)

3.  B gives A a basket of apples, thus transferring a real value —the apples— and receives a memory of the transaction by the defined price of 20 UTV, the money.

In this exchange, A receives a “good” from B, and gives B 20 units of money. In this transaction, the debt is cancelled. A has already paid B, and B has given A what A wanted to acquire. This means that, after the exchange, both parties have reached a state of equilibrium between themselves.

1.  B has now 20 UTV in favor, and A has 20 UTV against.

2.  This means that B has the right to acquire any good or service for the value of 20 UTV from the social group he/she belongs to, that is, the group as a social organism owes B this amount in “real value.”

3.  This also implies that A has an obligation to return to the group real value—goods and/or services—for the amount of 20 UTV.

As the transfer of UTV money is a “memory of the value of a transaction,” it makes no sense for someone who is in the negative to pay interest. This would be like saying that although we have already paid for our purchase, we must pay even more.

Mutual credit means that the group gives a credit to those who are in negative, and those who are in positive are giving the group a credit. The point being that those engaged in each transaction are “mutually balanced.”

There is no pre-established “maximum negative value limit” for users of the New Earth Promissory, rather users are encouraged to “go through zero” (up or down) as frequently as possible.”

Traditionally the limiting factor of such a system has been the transportation of goods and the services on offer. In most cases transport requires old money for the payment of fuel and maintenance. The New Earth Promissory overcomes this problem by interfacing with the New Earth Exchange through established and suitable mechanisms as and when necessary.

The New Earth Promissory is not usurious, since no one can control the issuing of your energy (or currency) except you.

        link: "Community Response Network",
        body: <<-BODY
Numerous communities throughout history have recognized the need to establish, within economic systems, the capacity to respond to exigencies anticipated and unanticipated.  The Earth is filled with dynamism and, from time to time, this dynamism places individuals and their well-being in jeopardy.  Within the New Earth Exchange, a Mutual Benefit Society is established wherein community members as well as non-community members can receive the benefit from a responsive, enlivened humanity which responds to joys and sorrows with abundance and generosity.
The Community Response Network begins with a constant communication platform which informs the global community as to the emergence of “needs” and “opportunities” emerging throughout the network.  Already successfully deployed in part with platforms like the Global Innovation Commons – a repository for technical knowledge to address emergent challenges – this exchange links resources, knowledge, community members and technology to those places in need of community level response.
As a Mutual Benefit Society, the demands for conventional insurance diminish and ultimately extinguish as the actuarial marginal profits accruing to insurers are replaced by expansive Community Response Networks in action.

        body: <<-BODY
The New Earth Gifting Network is a global platform serving to reconnect people within their local community through the simple and powerful act of sharing. 

The Gifting Network is the aspect of the New Earth Exchange which breaks beyond any notion of ‘exchange’ altogether. No exchange takes place when one either gives or receives a service and no one is permitted to charge or receive money for a service provided through the Gifting Network.  

The purpose of the Gifting Network is to:

• Help others in your community and open yourself to receiving help from those around you.
• Reduce the environmental impact of consumption by sharing the things we only use occasionally.
• Grow friendships, and cooperative practices in local communities.
• Use the skills you do have to benefit others and learn the skills you don’t have for a time you may need them.
• Reinvigorate local community spirit 
• Encourage random acts of kindness to become the foundation of human interaction

        title: "About the Sovereign Payment System",
        link: "Sovereign Payment System",
        body: <<-BODY
The New Earth Sovereign is an alternative currency which will be used for all commercial transactions between the New Earth’s various programs, initiatives, partners & affiliates and all non-residents & non-members who wish to engage with New Earth or between themselves. 

For exchange purposes only, 1 New Earth Sovereign = the average hourly income measured across a selection of nation states, and measured against a base currency (US Dollars). This metric ensures that the New Earth Sovereign remains noninflationary as the exchange rate adjusts to counteract the inflationary effects of other currencies.

The Sovereign payment system utilises electronic technology developed by Humoney. It is an electronic payment system, in which cash flow is anonymous. The System has been designed for the protection of human freedom, liberty and privacy through free trade. Its main purpose is to bring communities together and make them prosperous. Its key features include:

• It facilitates and protects free flow of the exchange of goods.
• It insures the flexibility of exchange of goods through financial transactions based on the most advanced electronic technologies.
• Eliminates the cost of financial transactions. Sovereign payments are free.
• It promotes unprecedented economic cooperation.
• Interest free Sovereign loan-system. 
• The granting of each loan is determined at the moment of the loan request depending on the user's economic performance, and on how the members of the community support each other.  The approval of a loan does not require administrative processing, and the payment will be automatically delivered when the need of the loan arises.

How the electronic paying system functions:

1.  To use the Sovereign financial service, the user must have a cell phone (smart phone) running iOS or the Android operating system.

2.  The mobile phone must have a Sovereign electronic wallet application software. The software is free and it can be downloaded from the Humoney website.

3.  There are two ways to put money into the Sovereign electronic wallet: 
• First, the user deposits an electronically certain amount of money into the Humoney bank account. The deposit can be in any currency. The electronic wallet value of the deposited currency will be displayed in the electronic wallet. The conversion of any currency is free with no commission for the transaction.
• Second, Sovereigns can be deposited through the system into the electronic wallet as a payment from another user.

4.  Sovereigns in a user’s electronic wallet can be converted and kept in any desired currency. The conversion between currencies is free.

5.  Any user of the system, who has an electronic wallet with Sovereigns in it, can pay, or be paid by any user of the system.

6.  Any user of this system can use his/her mobile phone to accept payment or to make Sovereign payments for any goods or services to users within the system.

7.  The actual payment is processed in the following way:
• The Seller presses the SELL button of the electronic wallet and then enters the price of the item for sale. 
• The amount appears on the electronic wallet display in QR code.
• The Buyer presses the BUY button of the electronic wallet, which takes a picture of the Seller’s QR code.  
• The Buyer’s phone displays the amount specified by the seller and the Buyer presses the YES button to accept the sale.
• For both, the Seller and the Buyer, a breakdown of the completed transaction and the new balance of their electronic wallet will be instantly displayed.

        title: "Why the New Earth Exchange is Launching Now",
        link: "Why",
        body: <<-BODY
The true purpose of an economy is to provide pathways which allow access to the unlimited abundance which already exists. Because, until now, we have collectively allowed vested interests to control the creation and supply of money, economic systems have been purposed to create an illusion of scarcity by limiting access to the natural abundance of our planet. 

Quite simply, there will not be a New Earth so long as the creation and supply of money is in the hands of those who do not have the best interests of people and planet at heart.  
If there is to be any meaningful change in this world, the control of the money supply must be given back to the people who use it.

This is the primary purpose of the New Earth Exchange.

        title: "How Vested Interests Have Used Money to Control People",
        link: "How Money Is Used",
        body: <<-BODY
Under the current fractional reserve banking model, operating in almost every country across the globe, money is created in the following way:

• The central bank decides to increase the money supply by say £1m. It does so by purchasing government bonds/treasury bills from a dealer in government securities. 
• In order to pay for these bonds the central bank creates a liability against itself – a simple accounting exercise.
• The dealer’s bank account is credited with £1m as payment for the bonds.
• £1m of credit money that did not previously exist, now exists in the banking system.
• Because the government bonds are interest bearing, the government has effectively borrowed the credit money for its banking system from what is effectively a private corporation at interest (there can never be enough money in circulation to pay back this loan because the interest payable on the government bonds has not yet been created – hence the perpetual and intentional cycle of boom and bust). 
• Income taxes pay the interest to the bondholders. 
• The central bank can control the supply of credit money by buying and selling its holding of government bonds at will. In this way does one single corporation control the entire economy.
• It is the promise of the future labour of mankind which underwrites this entire operation. The ‘security of the person’ (birth certificate) of every man, woman and child alive today is collateralized to fulfil this function, based on the presumption that we all will agree to stand as surety for the debt money created. Here we see again the true purpose of the birth registration process... indentured servitude.

The £1m created by the central bank can then be expanded to a theoretical £10m through the following process:

• The high street bank(s) who received the £1m from the dealer’s transaction is allowed to lend £900,000 of the original £1m, assuming a 10% fractional reserve requirement.
• However it does not lend any of the original £1m, if it did this no new money would be created. Instead it keeps the whole £1m in its vault and creates, out of thin air, up to another £9m to satisfy the 10% requirement.
• It can do this because it accepts promissory notes [loan application forms and offers] in exchange for credits to the borrowers’ transaction account. 
• The bank lies to the public, telling them that they are making a loan (that must be paid back at interest). 
• The bank then accepts the loan application form/offer as a promise to pay in accordance with the relevant national Bills of Exchange Act (much like the ‘promise to pay’ bank notes in your wallet). 
• Because they now have something of value from the ‘borrower,’ they are authorised by the banking system to create out of thin air the credit money that the ‘borrower’ wishes to ‘borrow.’
• In essence the bank has simply converted the ‘borrowers’ promissory note into useable credit money. They have not lent a single penny of their own money or of anyone else’s money. 100% of the monthly payments you make on a loan, mortgage or credit card are effectively profit to the banking system.
• It is the promise of future labour of the man acting as the legal fiction ‘borrower’ that increases the supply of fictional credit money in the fractional reserve system.
• Essentially it is us, the alleged lenders, who make the loan to the bank, not the other way round.

This credit expansion process is a massive fraud upon the people.

In reality we have never been debtors, and any notion that we are the true creditors is a fictional distraction. We simply are, and have always been, creators; we are the source of all fictional credit money currently in circulation. That power has always been ours. Now, at last, it’s time to cut out the middle man.
